# Deepfake Technology Using Python

Welcome to my **Deepfake Python** project! This repository demonstrates how to create a basic deepfake program using Python and several powerful libraries such as Mediapipe, NumPy, and OpenCV.

## Overview
In this project, we will create a deepfake application that maps the facial landmarks of one person onto another in real-time. The process involves extracting 3D landmarks, matching them, and using affine transformations to replicate facial expressions dynamically.

## Project Workflow
1. **Extract Landmarks from the Target Image**
   - Use the Mediapipe library to extract 3D facial landmarks from a static image of the face you want to use as the "deepfake face."

2. **Extract Landmarks in Real-Time**
   - Use your webcam to capture live facial landmarks and process them in real-time.

3. **Landmark Matching**
   - Match the real-time landmarks of your face with those of the target face using an affine transformation algorithm.
   - Interpret the landmarks as triangles to ensure seamless transitions and accurate expressions.

4. **Dynamic Expression Mimicry**
   - Replicate facial expressions dynamically. For instance:
     - If you smile, the deepfake face smiles.
     - If the target image shows a smile with teeth, the deepfake face attempts to mimic that even when you are not smiling.

## Example Output
By the end of this project, the deepfake face will mimic your real-time facial expressions, creating a smooth and natural transition of expressions. This method ensures that the deepfake adapts dynamically to the live input.

## Prerequisites
We recommend setting up a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Install the necessary libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
python -m venv deepfake_env
source deepfake_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `deepfake_env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- **Mediapipe**: For 3D facial landmark extraction.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time webcam input and image manipulation.

## Requirements
All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the command above.

## Context
This project is part of a larger initiative focused on **Action Recognition**, where facial and body movements are analyzed for real-time applications.
